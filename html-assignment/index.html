            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello, I'm Insoo Kim from <abbr title="Republic of Korea"> R.O.K.</abbr>, 
            and I am living with <em>my family,</em> including a 6-year-old corgi.<br>
            It is my 1<sup>st</sup> winter in Ottawa, so there are still many unfamiliar things.<br>
            However, I hope to adapt quickly and do well in life here and in the school program.<br>
            <br>
            I chose this program because I think it could give me a great opportunity to gain a variety of experiences.<br>
            Since my background in this area other than photography was <em>nothing</em>, I was nervous and worried.
            It's a bit challenging right now, but I'm hopeful it will get easier as I master all the techniques in the program.
            </p>
